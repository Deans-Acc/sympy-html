# Sympy-HTML

## WARNING

THE BACKEND ALLOWS FOR READING AND WRITING ARBITRARY FILES! ONLY GIVE ACCESS TO PEOPLE YOU TRUST!

## README

The purpose of this project is to provide a web REPL for sympy.

It is primarly designed for the IPad with Carnets, but it also works on Linux. (Windows not tested, but should work)

The project has 2 main parts:

- The Python WebSocket backend doing the calculations

- The HTML Frontend intended for use by the end user

## How to run

First install sympy, websockets and pint using pip. (Pint can be removed by deleting line 11 and line 62)

Then run main.py using the Jupyter Notebook or by running it directly.

Now you can just open the index.html file in your browser or run the small code snippet in the Notebook for a basic webserver. (Just use the url printed by main.py in the browser)

When using Carnets you must have the app in the foreground. (IOS freezes apps in the background)

## Notes

The backend only accepts connections from localhost. If you want other people to access the backend use the Trust command with their ip(v4).

Use the Help command for a quick definition of every custom command.

Save / Load uses the saves subdirectory, but plot.save has no restrictions!
